# web-scraping-challenge

Initially utilized Jupyter Notebook to file missions_to_mars.ipynb to setup scraping of Nasa Mars News Site and review the locations where latest new title and most recent paragraph reside using BeautifulSoup. 
Then searched the JPL Featured Space Image to pull the full image url after clicking the browser button.
Next is to pull in the Mars Facts table. I renamed the columns and axis to remove the 0 and 1 showing at header.
I pulled in the Hemispheres images from the ZUSGS Astrogeology site and printed the titles and image urls by creating a dictionary and looping through the data.
I copied Jupyter Notebook into a py file, but had trouble getting any of the Flask data code to effectively run.
